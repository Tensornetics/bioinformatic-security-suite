# Security Best Practices

This document provides an overview of the security measures implemented in the bioinformatic security suite.

## Authentication and Authorization

- User accounts are created and managed using [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/)
- Passwords are hashed and salted using [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) before being stored in the database
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is implemented using [Google Authenticator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Authenticator)

## Input validation and sanitization

- All user input is thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Input is checked for proper length and format before being passed to the system
- Input is sanitized using the [OWASP library](https://owasp.org/java-html-sanitizer/)

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

- The server is configured to use HTTPS to ensure that all communications between clients and the server are secure
- SSL certificates are validated using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

## Data encryption

- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit using [TLS 1.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security)
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)
- Encryption keys are securely stored using [Key Management System (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/)
