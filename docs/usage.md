# Using the Bioinformatic Security Suite

The Bioinformatic Security Suite is designed to be easy to use, with a simple web-based interface for managing and protecting your sensitive data. Here are some instructions on how to get started.

## 1. Log in

To log in to the web interface, navigate to the URL provided to you by the administrator. You will be prompted to enter your username and password. If you have been set up with biometric authentication, you will also have the option to log in using your face or fingerprint.

## 2. Encrypt data

Once you have logged in, you can begin encrypting your sensitive data. You can encrypt individual files or entire directories by selecting them in the interface and clicking the "Encrypt" button. The encrypted files will have a new filename with the suffix `.encrypted`.

## 3. Manage access

You can also use the web interface to manage access to your data. By default, only you will have access, but you can also invite other users and assign them different levels of access. For example, you may want to give one user the ability to read and write to your data, while another user can only read.

## 4. View monitoring and logs

You can also view real-time monitoring and logs from the web interface, so you can see who has accessed your data, when, and from where. This information can be useful for troubleshooting, compliance, or security audits.

## 5. Delete

Finally, it is important to mention that you can delete any of the files that have been encrypted, but also have the option to delete the file permanently.

## 6. Compliance

You can also check the compliance status of your system with industry standards and regulations. All the information in this section should be found in the `regulatory_compliance.md` file.

Please contact the administrator for further information, questions, or troubleshooting.
